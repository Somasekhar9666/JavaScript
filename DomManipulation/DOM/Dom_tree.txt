 What is the DOM Tree
 The DOM (Document Object Model) Tree is a representation of an HTML or XML document in the form of a tree structure. The DOM tree defines the logical structure of a document, where each node in the tree represents part of the document, like elements, attributes, text, etc.

Root of the DOM Tree: The <html> tag is the root node, and everything within it (like <head>, <body>, etc.) forms the child nodes.
Branches of the DOM Tree: The child elements of each node (like nested divs, spans, or paragraphs) are like branches connecting the root and other elements.
Leaves of the DOM Tree: Text or attributes that have no children are like the leaves of the tree.

<html>
  <head></head>
  <body>
    <div>
      <p>Hello World!</p>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>



The DOM tree representation for the above HTML:
<html>
  ├─ <head>
  └─ <body>
      └─ <div>
          └─ <p> "Hello World!"




What are Nodes?
A Node is the basic unit in the DOM tree. Every element, attribute, or piece of text in the DOM is a node. There are different types of nodes in the DOM, such as:

Element Nodes: Represent HTML elements like <div>, <p>, <h1>, etc.
Text Nodes: Represent the text inside the HTML elements.
Attribute Nodes: Represent the attributes (like id, class, etc.) of HTML elements.
Document Nodes: Represent the entire document as the root of the DOM.

<div class="container">
  <p>Some text</p>
</div>
Here:

<div> and <p> are element nodes.
"Some text" is a text node.
class="container" is an attribute node.

****all HTML elemts are nodes but all nodes are not hml elements , because text node is not  a element


so  this buliding blocks will form the DOM :
